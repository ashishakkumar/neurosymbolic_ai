Hypotension was \\nfelt to be due to fluid shifts from paracentesis on the day \\nprior to admission as well as low PO intake in the setting of \\nAMS. Hypotension and ___ resolved with IV albumin.

It was felt to be due to \\nfluid shifts from paracentesis on ___, as well as likely \\nhypovolemia given AMS and decreased PO intake. No concern for \\nbleeding or sepsis with baseline CBC and lack of fever. She \\ncontinued to received IV albumin during her hospital course, \\nwith which her SBP improved to ___ and patient remained \\nasymptomatic.  \\n\\n# Hyperkalemia: Patient presented with K 6.7 with EKG changes. \\nGiven low Na, likely the result of low effective arterial volume \\nleading to poor K excretion, with likely exacerbation from ___. \\nAM cortisol was normal. K improved with insulin and kayexalate \\nand K was 5.2 on day of discharge. Bactrim was held during \\nhospital course. \\n\\n# ___: Patient presented with Cr 0.7 from baseline Cr is \\n0.3-0.4. It was felt to be likely due to volume shift from her \\nparacentesis on the day prior to admission as well as now low \\neffective arterial volume, likely ___ poor PO intake ___ AMS. Cr \\nimproved to 0.4 with albumin administration. Furosemide and \\nBactrim were held during hospital course.   \\n\\n#GOC: The ___ son (HCP) met with Dr. ___ \\noutpatient hepatologist) during ___ hospital course. They \\ndiscussed that the patient is not a transplant candidate \\ngivenevere underlying lung disease (FEV1 ~0.8), hypoxia, RV \\ndilation and very low BMI. A more conservative approach was \\nrecommended and the patient was transitioned to DNR/DNI. The \\npatient agreed with this plan. She was treated with the goal of \\ntreating any any correctable issues. Social work met with the \\npatient prior to discharge. The patient was interested in \\nfollowing up with palliative care, for which an outpatient \\nreferral was made. \\n \\n# Altered Mental Status: Patient presented with confusion that \\nwas most likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Based on \\noutpatient records, patient has had steady decline in \\ndecompensated cirrhosis and mental status. No signs of infection \\nand head CT was negative as well. Mental status improved with \\nlactulose in the ED and patient reports that she has not been \\ntaking lactulose regularly at home. Patient was also continued \\non rifaximin.   \\n\\n# HCV Cirrhosis: Genotype 3a. Patient is decompensated with \\nincreasing ascites and worsening hepatic encephalopathy. She is \\ndependent on twice weekly paracentesis. Spironolactone was \\nrecently stopped due to hyperkalemia. Patient is not a \\ntransplant candidate given her comorbidities COPD per outpatient \\nhepatologist. The patient would like to continue biweekly \\nparacenteses as an outpatient.\\n\\n# HIV: Most recent CD4 count 173 on ___. HIV viral load on \\n___ was undetectable. She was continued on her home regimen \\nof raltegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Bactrim \\nprophylaxis was held during admission because of hyperkalemia.   \\n\\n\\n# COPD: Patient on 3L NC at home. She was continued on her home \\nregimen.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\\n-Follow up with Palliative Care as outpatient\\n-Bactrim prophylaxis (HIV+) was held during hospital course due \\nto ___.

Your confusion improved \\nwith lactulose. Your blood pressure improved with extra fluids \\nand your potassium improved as well. You also had small degree \\nof kidney injury when you came to the hospital, and this also \\nimproved with fluids. While you were here, you discussed \\nchanging your goals of care to focusing on symptom management \\nand treatment of reversible processes, such as an infection. \\nWhile you were in the hospital, you were seen by one of our \\nsocial workers.
